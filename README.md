# ETL-Project
 
My goal here is to track stats for every videogame that is crowdfunded on kickstarter and then released on Steam. I would like to expand it to include other platforms besides Steam but I don't know if I will get there.

I have gathered several datasets downloaded from kaggle and adjusted them to show 'reviews' for the games. I would really like to add a dataset that shows the sales of each game, so that the relative success of a game could be measured in more than one way, but I haven't gotten there yet.

This project also required a significant amount of web-scraping which I am still getting used to. As of tonight, my project is unfinished and should be marked incomplete. I am still currently in the Transform phase of ETL.
